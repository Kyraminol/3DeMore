# 3DeMore

Reset all demo use counters and exit in few seconds.
Simple, minimal, functional.

# Building
3DeMore needs smealum's [libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) and steveice10's buildtools.

To clone the repository with the submodule correctly, use:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Kyraminol/3DeMore.git`

If you have already checked out the code without the submodules, you can run the following command in the project directory to fetch the submodule data:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Credits

Thanks to smealum for his ctrulib and steveice10 for buildtools.
